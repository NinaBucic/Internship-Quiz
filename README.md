## üì¶ Setup Instructions

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This project uses **Yarn** and is powered by **Turborepo**.

### 1. Clone the repository and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NinaBucic/Internship-Quiz.git
cd Internship-Quiz
yarn install
```

### 2. Set up your environment variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` folder. Example:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:3001/quizdb?schema=public"
JWT_SECRET=super_secure_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=3600s
```

Make sure PostgreSQL is running locally or use Docker.

### 3. Setup the database and Prisma client

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
```

This will run the initial migration and generate the Prisma client.

### 4. Start the app

From the root of the project:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start both frontend and backend via Turborepo (frontend: `localhost:5173`, backend: `localhost:3000/api`).
